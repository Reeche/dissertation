# Modeling MCRL
This repository contains code for learning mechanisms implemented for modeling how people learn how to plan.

The algorithms implemented are:
1. LVOC and its variants
2. Hierarchical LVOC and its variants
3. REINFORCE and its variants
4. RSSL
5. Hybrid model combining Strategy selection algorithm (RSSL) with Strategy Discovery algorithms (LVOC, REINFORCE)
